# Hello World :video_game: :computer:

I am **Spencer Rafada**. I am from the Philippines :philippines:. I like to code, play video games, and learn different things.

I started BS Computer Engineering in 2015 and that is when I discovered the world of programming. Although I have discovered programming for a long time now, I have not had the passion until I got back from my volunteer mission in 2019. I am currently finishing my degree in Brigham Young University-Idaho and I am expected to graduate by Spring of 2023.

## Languages I know:
- Python
- C++
